- Add 2 binding sets (one for camera/projection data, one for per-object position): https://developer.nvidia.com/vulkan-shader-resource-binding. This image is closest to what I'm looking for: https://d29g4g2dyqv443.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/akamai/gameworks/blog/Vulkan_Shader_Resource/vulkan_resbinding_effective.png

- Revise object system to use instancing.
	- Maybe also figure out a way to re-use pipelines efficiently?
- Make binding set system more generic
- Frames in flight

- Shared pointer instead of this horrible pointer management. Prioritize references over ptrs.
- Get rid of "default" class constructors as much as possible.
- Formatting
- VALGRIND
